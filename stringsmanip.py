# Manipulating strings with python

# text = "Hallo dir!"

# print(text[0])

# white spaces are counted

# text = "Hallo dir!"

# print(text[5])

#Possile to print 2 caracters

# text = "Hallo dir!"

# print(text[0:2])

# counting the number of caracters we use

# text = "Hallo dir!"

# print(len(text))

# Substracting a part of our text using substring

# text = "Hallo dir!"
# substring = text[6:10]

# print(substring)

#Possibility to remove whitespaces ,andpreceding in our text using stripped function strip()
# text = "     Hallo dir!      "
# stripped = text.strip()

# print(stripped)
# Upper case and lower case

# a = "Hello, You!"

# Possibility to replacing a content inside a string

# a = "This is a snowy day"
